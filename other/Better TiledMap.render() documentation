Better documentation for the TiledMap.render() method.
        
/**
 * What should be the actual TiledMap.render actual documentation:
 *
 ** @param x
 *            - Pixels - Render location based on the screen itself, the
 *            window in which the game is.
 ** @param y
 *            - Pixels - Same as above but for vertical. Note, positive
 *            means down.
 ** @param sx
 *            - Tiles - The top left corner of the render location on
 *            the entire map.
 ** @param sy
 *            - Tiles - Same, but y coordinate.
 ** @param Width
 *            - Tiles - How many tiles you are going to render
 *            horizontally.
 ** @param Height
 *            - Tiles - Same but vertically. Hint: Use something like:
 *            SCREENHEIGHT/TILE_WIDTH + 2
